To allow other people to write to the SUI object in a smart contract, you can use access control mechanisms within the contract code. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Define a mapping variable to keep track of the access rights for each address:\n\n```solidity\nmapping(address => bool) public writers;\n```\n\n2. Create a modifier to allow only authorized writers to execute specific functions:\n\n```solidity\nmodifier onlyWriter {\n  require(writers[msg.sender], \"Unauthorized writer\");\n  _;\n}\n```\n\n3. Implement a function to grant write access to specific addresses:\n\n```solidity\nfunction grantAccess(address _writer) public {\n  writers[_writer] = true;\n}\n```\n\n4. Implement the functions that you want other people to execute, and include the \"onlyWriter\" modifier:\n\n```solidity\nfunction writeToSUI(uint256 _data) public onlyWriter {\n  // Write to SUI object here\n}\n```\n\nBy using this approach, only addresses that have been granted access through the `grantAccess` function will be able to write to the SUI object in the smart contract."
